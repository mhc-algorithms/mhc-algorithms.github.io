	This is the homepage, it links to the other pages and gives an overview

The first two simulations need to be updated, as the css style sheet, the javascript, and the html are all in the html files. This is something we would like to change in order to make the code easier to access.

The following files correspond to the Stable Matching Simulation:

StableMatchIntro.html
	this page gives definitions and explanation of the stable matching problem, and links to the simulator

StableMatchingSimulator.html
	this file contains the style, the html and the javascript for the stable matching simulation.
	The code references students and schools, as this was the original way we outlined the problem, but these are shown to the user as families and animals instead.
