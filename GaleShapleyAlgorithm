      <b>Gale-Shapley Algorithm for Stable Matching</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this scenario, we are matching students with schools. The Gale-Shapley algorithm matches by 
        having one group request the other, and the other either accepts or declines. 
      <br> <br>
      Suppose we have the students request the schools. The student will request their most-preferred school. 
      If the school has not already accepted another student, then it will accept.
      <br> <br>
      If the school has already accepted another student, then there are two options.
      <br> <br>
      1) If the school prefers this student over the current student it has accepted, then it will abandon the old student and accept the new one. 
      <br> <br>
      2) If the school does not prefer this student over the current student, it will reject the student.
      <br>
      <br> <br>
      <br>
      If a student has been rejected or abandoned, then they will choose their next prefered school to repeat.
      <br>
      <br>
      This algorithm ensures that every student and every school each has a match, and that the matches are stable, since every student and school are matched in a manner so that there would not be a situation where both a student and school prefer each other over the matches they have.
