      <b>Gale-Shapley Algorithm for Stable Matching</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this scenario, we are matching animals with families. The Gale-Shapley algorithm matches by 
        having one group request the other, and the other either accepts or declines. 
      <br> <br>
      Suppose we have the animals request the families. The animals will request their most-preferred family. 
      If the family has not already accepted another animal, then it will accept.
      <br> <br>
      If the family has already accepted another animal, then there are two options.
      <br> <br>
      1) If the family prefers this animal over the current animal it has accepted, then it will abandon the old animal and accept the new one. 
      <br> <br>
      2) If the family does not prefer this animal over the current animal, it will reject the animal.
      <br>
      <br> <br>
      <br>
      If an animal has been rejected or abandoned, then they will choose their next prefered family to repeat the process.
      <br>
      <br>
      This algorithm ensures that every animal and every family each has a match, and that the matches are stable, since every animal and family are matched in a manner so that there would not be a situation where both a student and school prefer each other over the matches they have.
