Let's break arr down into equal halves and pretend that we already know the Maximum Subarray Sum of each of them:<br>
				<b>sub_one = [-2, 1], sum_one = 1           sub_two = [-3, 8], sum_two = 8</b><br>
				We'll explain how we know sum_one and sum_two in a minute.<br><br>

				The Maximum Subarray for <b>arr</b> is either <b>sub_one</b>, <b>sub_two</b>, some overlap between <b>sub_one</b> and <b>sub_two</b> called <b>sub_overlap</b>.<br>
				So first we must calculate <b>sub_overlap</b>, then we can chose the largest of the three sums.<br><br>

				To calculate <b>sub_overlap</b> we will get a start index from <b>sub_one</b> and an end index from <b>sub_two</b>.<br>
				To do this, we build a maximal <b>sub_sub_one</b> from right to left:<br>
				<b>
					the first sub_sub_one is empty<br>
					sub_sub_one = []<br><br>

					now, we try the second sub_sub_one array with a length of 1:<br>
					new_sub_sub_one = [1]<br>
					the sum of new_sub_sub_one > the sum of sub_sub_one, so sub_sub_one = new_sub_sub_one<br><br>

					now, we try the third sub_sub_one array with a length of 2:<br>
					new_sub_sub_one = [1, -2]<br>
					the sum of new_sub_sub_one < the sum of sub_sub_one, so sub_sub_one stays the same<br><br>

					we have reached the end of sub_one with sub_sub_one = [1]<br><br>
				</b>
				So now we know that the start index of <b>sub_overlap</b> = 1.<br><br>
				To find the end index of <b>sub_overlap</b>, we build a maximal <b>sub_sub_two</b> from left to right:<br>
				<b>
					the first sub_sub_two is empty<br>
					sub_sub_two = []<br><br>

					now, we try the second sub_sub_two array with a length of 1:<br>
					new_sub_sub_two = [-3]<br>
					the sum of new_sub_sub_two > the sum of sub_sub_two, so sub_sub_two = new_sub_sub_two<br><br>

					now, we try the third sub_sub_two array with a length of 2:<br>
					new_sub_sub_two = [-3, 8]<br>
					the sum of new_sub_sub_two > the sum of sub_sub_two, so sub_sub_two = new_sub_sub_two<br><br>

					we have reached the end of sub_two with sub_sub_two = [5]<br><br>
				</b>
				So now we know that the end index of <b>sub_overlap</b> = 3, and we can calculate <b>sum_overlap</b> to be sum(arr[1] through arr[3]) = <b>6</b>.<br><br>

				Finally we can compare <b>sum_one</b>, <b>sum_two</b>, and <b>sum_overlap</b> to find that <b>sum_two</b> is the greatest, so the Maximum Subarray Sum of <b>arr</b> is <b>arr[3] through arr[3] = 8</b>.<br><br><br><br>



				This proceedure is the recursive step we'll be using. We break the given array down into smaller and smaller subarrays until we reach a base case.<br>
				Using our <b>arr</b> example:<br>
				[-2, 1, -3, 8] =><br>
				[-2, 1] and [-3, 8]<br>
				[-2, 1] =><br>
				-2 and 1<br>
				Here we would compare <b>sub_one</b>: -2, <b>sub_two</b>: 1, and <b>sub_overlap</b>: -1<br>
				We would choose <b>sub_two</b>, since it is larger.<br>
				This is how we got <b>sub_one</b>, <b>sum_one</b>, <b>sub_two</b>, and <b>sum_two</b> in the above description of the recursive step!<br><br><br>
