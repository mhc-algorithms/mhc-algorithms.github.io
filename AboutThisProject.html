			<p id="About">
				This project was created by Mount Holyoke College students Ivy O'Neal-Odom ('20) and Caroline Knote ('20). We worked on it as an independent study during the spring semester of 2020 and were advised by Audrey St. John.
				<br><br>
				We presented on this project for the Mount Holyoke Senior Symposium. Our presentation can be found <a href = "https://youtu.be/5siTUYJpSAw">here</a>.
				<br><br>
				Our intention for this project was to create interactive elements that could be used by students in algorithms courses in order to better understand some of the more difficult algorithms that they might find in their course. 
				<br><br>
				We created our modules with the intention to have interactive applications that gave immediate feedback to a student so that they could learn as they interacted with the program. 
				<br><br>
				We created modules for three algorithms: Stable Matching, the maximum sub array sum problem, and the knapsack problem. We hope to pass this project on to other students who may be interested in working more on this and creating other modules, as there are many algorithms that we did not get the chance to cover.
