		Hello! Welcome to the stable matching simulator!
		<br>
		This website is here to help you understand stable matching. 
		<br>
		<br>
		First, we want to introduce some key definitions for understanding this concept.
		<br>

		Suppose we have two groups, Animals and Families. We are trying to find families to adopt animals. Every animal and family has a preference list of who they want to be matched with.
		<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Match</b>: the set of family-animal pairs where each family/animal is in <u>at most</u> 1 pair.

		<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Perfect Match</b>: the set of family-animal pairs where each family/animal is in <u>exactly</u> one pair.

		<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Instability or unstable pair</b>: a family-animal pair not in the current match, such that the family prefers the animal over the one it was paired with, and the animal prefers the family over the one it was paired with.

		<br><br>
		<u>Example:</u> We have two families, the Adams and the Zhangs. The Adams were paired with a cat, and the Zhangs were paired with a dog. However, the Zhangs prefered the cat over the dog, and the cat prefered the Zhangs over the Adams. In this case, both the Zhangs and the cat would rather be with each other than what they were assigned. This is an unstable match.

		<br><br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stable Match</b>: A perfect match where there is no instability.

		When you click to the next page, you will be presented with an oppertunity to create matches based on preferences. The goal is to create a stable matching.
		<br><br>

		In order to create a stable matching, every family must be paired to exactly one animal, and every animal must be paired to exactly one family. There must also be no instabilities. 
		<br><br>

		We recommend that you start with a smaller number of families and animals as you are learning how to create stable matches. You can increase the number as you feel more confident! 

		<br><br>
		We recommend you spend at least 5-10 minutes manipulating the pairs and trying to understand how stable matches are created and why a match may be unstable. If you find an instability in your pairing, try to resolve it!
		<br><br>

		As you begin to understand how to create stable matches, start to think of patterns or strategies that result in stable matches. Can you think of an algorithm that always results in a stable match? 
		<br><br>

		With all this in mind, go on and try it out!
